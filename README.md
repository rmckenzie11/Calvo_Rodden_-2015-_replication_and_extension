# A Replication and Extension of Calvo and Rodden (2015), looking at electoral bias in UK elections 1950-2019

Code and data for the Paper Replication Project in Gov 1006.

Calvo and Rodden (2015) attempt to address the puzzle of multi-party competition in democracies by building an analytical model of the relationship between a party’s territorial distribution of support and its vote-seat curve, and then use their model to analyze election results in the UK from 1950-2010. Their model shows an increase in majoritarian biases as the number of parties contesting an election goes up, that small parties are hurt when their vote is dispersed, and that large parties are hurt when their vote is
concentrated. I was able to successfully replicate all aspects of their paper, including analysis outside of R using WinBugs. The last few years have been tumultuous in British politics, so I tested Calvo and Rodden’s model on updated UK election data, looking specifically at the electoral fortunes of the Scottish National Party in the UK as a whole and specifically in Scotland. I found that Calvo and Rodden’s model was able to determine both majoritarian and partisan bias, even for regional parties that don’t contest districts due to being small, but don’t contest districts by design, but the model struggled with calculating how many seats these parties would win. I also looked at election results in Scotland independent of other UK results, and found that the model often came to surprisingly different conclusions than looking at UK elections in general.
